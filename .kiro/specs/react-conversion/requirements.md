# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting the existing Flow Connector Figma plugin from vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript to use React.js for the user interface. The plugin currently has a complex UI with multiple tabs, form controls, color pickers, sliders, and a live preview system. Converting to React will improve code maintainability, component reusability, and provide better state management for the complex UI interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Flow Connector plugin, I want the UI to be built with React.js, so that the codebase is more maintainable and follows modern development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is loaded THEN the UI SHALL be rendered using React components instead of vanilla HTML
2. WHEN users interact with any UI element THEN the functionality SHALL remain identical to the current implementation
3. WHEN the plugin communicates with Figma's backend THEN the message passing system SHALL continue to work without changes
4. IF the conversion is complete THEN all existing features SHALL work exactly as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on the plugin, I want the UI components to be modular and reusable, so that adding new features and maintaining existing ones is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the React version THEN the UI SHALL be split into logical, reusable components
2. WHEN a component handles form inputs THEN it SHALL use proper React state management
3. WHEN components need to share data THEN they SHALL use appropriate React patterns (props, context, or state lifting)
4. IF a component is used in multiple places THEN it SHALL be designed for reusability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the Flow Connector plugin, I want all existing functionality to work identically after the React conversion, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the plugin THEN the two-panel layout (left controls, right preview) SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN I interact with tabs (Arrow/Label) THEN the tab switching SHALL work identically
3. WHEN I adjust any control (color picker, sliders, dropdowns) THEN the live preview SHALL update in real-time
4. WHEN I select frames in Figma THEN the plugin SHALL respond with the same status updates and auto-creation behavior
5. WHEN I create or edit connections THEN all arrow and label customization options SHALL work identically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the project, I want the build system to be configured for React development, so that I can efficiently develop and build the plugin.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN React and necessary dependencies SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN building the project THEN the build system SHALL compile React components into a single bundle for Figma
3. WHEN developing THEN hot reloading or efficient rebuild processes SHALL be available
4. IF using TypeScript THEN React components SHALL have proper type definitions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the plugin, I want the React components to follow best practices, so that the code is clean and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating components THEN they SHALL follow React best practices (proper hooks usage, component composition, etc.)
2. WHEN managing state THEN appropriate React state management patterns SHALL be used
3. WHEN handling side effects THEN useEffect and other hooks SHALL be used correctly
4. IF components become complex THEN they SHALL be split into smaller, focused components
