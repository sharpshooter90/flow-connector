# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to select multiple frames simultaneously and perform bulk operations on connections and their properties. Users can select multiple frames without holding modifier keys, see bulk action states in the header, draw connections between all selected frames at once, and update connection properties (arrows and labels) for multiple connections simultaneously.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select multiple frames without holding shift or other modifier keys, so that I can easily work with multiple frames in a more intuitive way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a frame THEN the system SHALL add that frame to the current selection without requiring modifier keys
2. WHEN a user clicks on an already selected frame THEN the system SHALL deselect that frame from the current selection
3. WHEN multiple frames are selected THEN the system SHALL visually indicate all selected frames with appropriate highlighting
4. WHEN a user clicks on empty space THEN the system SHALL clear all frame selections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the bulk action state in the header when multiple frames are selected, so that I understand what bulk operations are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple frames are selected THEN the header SHALL display the count of selected frames
2. WHEN multiple frames are selected THEN the header SHALL show available bulk actions
3. WHEN only one or no frames are selected THEN the header SHALL display the normal single-frame interface
4. WHEN the selection changes THEN the header SHALL update immediately to reflect the new state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to draw connections to all selected frames with a single action, so that I can quickly create multiple connections without repetitive clicking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple frames are selected THEN the header SHALL display a "Draw connections to all selections {count}" action button
2. WHEN the user clicks the bulk connection action THEN the system SHALL create connections between all selected frames
3. WHEN creating bulk connections THEN the system SHALL use the current connection settings (arrow style, color, etc.)
4. WHEN bulk connections are created THEN the system SHALL apply consistent styling to all new connections
5. IF there are existing connections between selected frames THEN the system SHALL not create duplicate connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to update properties of multiple connection arrows and labels together when they are under selected frames, so that I can efficiently style multiple connections at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple frames with connections are selected THEN the properties panel SHALL show bulk editing options
2. WHEN a user changes arrow properties in bulk mode THEN the system SHALL apply changes to all connections associated with selected frames
3. WHEN a user changes label properties in bulk mode THEN the system SHALL apply changes to all labels associated with selected frames
4. WHEN properties are mixed across selected connections THEN the system SHALL indicate mixed states in the UI
5. WHEN bulk property changes are applied THEN the system SHALL update all affected connections simultaneously
6. IF some connections cannot be modified THEN the system SHALL apply changes to modifiable connections and report any failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during bulk operations, so that I understand what actions are being performed and their results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during the process
2. WHEN bulk connections are being created THEN the system SHALL show progress or completion indicators
3. WHEN bulk property updates are applied THEN the system SHALL highlight affected connections temporarily
4. WHEN bulk operations complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary of actions performed
5. IF bulk operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL clearly communicate what succeeded and what failed
